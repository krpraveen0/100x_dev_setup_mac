## 4. ðŸŒ€ Setup Zinit Plugin Manager

Zinit should already be installed by `.zshrc`. If not:

```

## 5. ðŸŽ¨ Configure Your Zsh Environment

Link or copy `.zshrc` to your home directory:

```bash
cp .zshrc ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Powerlevel10k will run a visual prompt wizard.

## 6. âœ… Verify Everything Works

```bash
which brew
which zinit
zinit list
nvm --version
pyenv versions
docker --version
zoxide query .
```

## ðŸ§  Bonus Tips

- `p10k configure` â€“ Customize your prompt
- `pipx list` â€“ See installed Python tools
- `brew upgrade` â€“ Keep your system up to date
